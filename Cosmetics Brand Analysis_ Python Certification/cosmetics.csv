2320299,BURBERRY,Perfume Gift Sets,Burberry Her Eau de Parfum Gift Set,no size,USD 136,5.0,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin.

2320364,Carolina Herrera,Perfume Gift Sets,Good Girl Gift Set,no size,USD 123,5.0,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,0,1

Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,0,1

2352508,CLINIQUE,Perfume Gift Sets,Perfectly Happy Set,no size,USD 55,0.0,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,1,1

1739317,dior,Cologne,Sauvage Eau de Toilette,2 oz/ 60 mL,EUR 63,4.5,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body.

Precautions:-Avoid the face. Do not use directly on an open wound.-Do not ingest. This product is for topical use only. -Do not use while pregnant or nursing. Not intended for use by children. A note on CBD: -You may have heard about CBD (cannabidol)- a phytocannabinoid- from all its buzz lately. CBD- or activated hemp extract- is different from hemp seed oil (or cannabis sativa seed oil)- an ingredient which does not contain CBD's restorative and soothing benefits. But- not all CBD is created equal. Full-spectrum CBD- which is what is used in this oil- retains the plant’s original terpenes and other supporting phytocannabinoids. Ellis Brooklyn uses only CBD that is grown pesticide-free in Colorado- non-psychoactive and hemp-derived. ,1,0

2254704,Floral street,Rollerballs & Travel Size,Discovery Set,8 x 0.05 oz/ 1.5 mL,USD 19,4.0,"Suggested Usage:
-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. 
-After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. 
-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. 
-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.

 Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?:
The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.

2175115,givenchy,Cologne,Gentleman Givenchy Cologne,3.4oz/100mL,EUR 72,3.5,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,0,0

This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,1,0

1905843,HERBIVORE,Night Creams,Moon Fruit Superfruit Night Treatment,no size,USD 58,4.0,"Suggested Usage:-Moon Fruit is a concentrated night cream- not a mask. Due to a high content of natural butters- this product needs to be massaged thoroughly into skin. If left on the surface of the skin- like a mask- it will not absorb fully and the ingredients will not be effective.
-Thoroughly massage a small amount in an even layer to clean- dry skin until the color is fully absorbed. 
-If used in combination with other products- apply Moon Fruit after cleansing and toning/misting but before other moisturizers. 
-Follow with one of Herbivore’s facial oils for extra hydration and to lock in moisture. -Moon Fruit was formulated to work especially well with our facial oils. Herbivore suggests pairing them together for superior results. 

-Please note that directly after application skin may feel tight- but will soften within a few hours as exfoliation takes place and the product absorbs deeply into the skin. -Allow plenty of time for this product to do its job- preferably overnight. 
-Since Moon Fruit is not a mask you do not need to wash it off in the morning. 
 Precautions:-For daytime use- avoid direct sunlight and use an SPF to protect skin from increased photosensitivity caused by the natural enzymes and AHA’s present in Moon Fruit.

2328516,HUDA BEAUTY,Perfume,KAYALI DÉJÀ VU WHITE FLOWER | 57,1.7oz/50mL,USD 85,4.5,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body.

Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil.

Tips and tricks:
-Exfoliate well prior to use with an oil-free body scrub or body brush.
-Remove rings before using the mitt.
-Shake the bottle a second time halfway through your full-body application to disperse the Argan Oil.

2175156,Lancôme,Perfume,La Vie Est Belle En Rose,3.4oz/100mL,EUR 109,4.5,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,0,0

2317709,michael kors,Perfume Gift Sets,Michael Kors Signature Set,no size,USD 122,0.0,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,1,1

2025310,NARS,Lip Sets,Audacious Lipstick Keepsake Set,3 x 0.14 oz/ 4.3 g,USD 79,4.5,Suggested Usage:-For full coverage with one stroke- apply directly from the bullet or with a lip brush.Artist Tip:“You can dab foundation on lips to create a flesh-toned look. Foundation can also be used as a base to neutralize the natural lip color. This technique ensures any color applied on top goes on true. Lip color can be applied with a fingertip for a softer- more stained look- directly from the applicator for more definition- or with a brush for a precise application.”—François Nars- Founder and Creative Director of NARS CosmeticsFor bold lips: “These are the kind of lips that are drawn perfectly and are immaculately defined. Start with a lip pencil—this fills in your lips and will fix the color. A lip pencil also gives real depth to whatever you apply on top. Your lip pencil should be close to the color of your lipstick—within a shade or two is fine. First outline your lips very carefully with the pencil. Then fill in the rest. Apply your lipstick on top. Blot with a tissue. Reapply another coat of lipstick or a touch of gloss. Blotting gets rid of excess lipstick- sets the color- and helps the application last longer. For even longer wear- layer translucent loose powder between coats of lipstick.”—François Nars- Founder and Creative Director of NARS Cosmetics,1,1

In Brazil- they spritz fragrance all over and head to toe.-To heighten the Cheirosa ’62 experience- pair with Brazilian Bum Bum Cream (sold separately).-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body.

2177541,Tory Burch,Perfume Gift Sets,Tory Burch Deluxe Mini Duo,no size,USD 22,4.5,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,0,1

Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,0,0

Adding this curve to the band will help when applying to the eyelid. -Wrap lashes around a makeup brush handle for a few minutes before applying to work out the stiffness. -Apply lash glue (sold separately) to the band and wait approximately 20 seconds for it to become tacky.-While looking downward into a mirror- apply the lash to your eyelid positioning the band as close to your natural lashes as possible. Apply to the center of the eyelid first- and then apply the inner and outer corners.-Allow the glue to dry completely. It will be clear once thoroughly dry.-Apply mascara to further blend the false lash to your natural lash. Removal:-Remove the lashes before you remove any of your eye makeup. If you remove them carefully the lash can be reused numerous times- especially if you did not put mascara on it.-Hold the lash at the outer corner and peel it off the eyelid from the outer corner toward the nose. It won’t hurt.-Add a small amount of a cosmetic oil to a cotton swab and run along the lash line to help soften the glue if needed. Precautions:-Avoid direct contact with the eyes. In case of contact- thoroughly wash out the eye with clean water. If irritation or redness persists- seek medical attention. ,0,1
